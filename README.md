# Timecard Backup
A web app to easily track your work hours. Deployed at [timecard-backup.app](https://www.timecard-backup.app/)

Ever gotten a suspiciously low paycheck from an hourly employer? Timecard systems
can be prone to errors or be edited erroneously by management. This app helps easily
keep a redundant record of your hours to verify your compensation.

## Features
Hours are tracked by clocking in and out as you would with a normal timecard. Custom
start times can be entered to clock in early and begin tracking as your work starts.
